        <p>Okay, I get it. Enough background. How do I get really big scores in Mario Kart Tour? The answer is… little by little. Your course score is affected by many elements, including things both inside and outside the actual race. All of these affect your final score. It may take some time to figure out how to get a lot of points in one race, but here are some tips for improving your scores:</p>
        <p>Outside Race elements:</p>

            <button class="accordion">Base Stat Totals of your Characters, Karts, and Items</button>
            <div class="panel">
              <p>Raise your Base Stats to the max! If you cap out, use a points-cap ticket to go even further.</p>
            </div>

            <button class="accordion">Base Levels of any Favorite courses of your Characters, Karts, and Items</button>
            <div class="panel">
              <p>Any Favorite Characters, Karts or Gliders that have a skill level of 2 or higher get their base stat multiplied. Anything with an enormous level gets a ton of points like this.</p>
            </div>
            
            <button class="accordion">The Race’s CC</button>
            <div class="panel">
              <p>Racing at a faster CC grants you more points for winning. Additionally, the CPU characters race better and are harder to defeat at faster CCs too.</p>
            </div>
            
            <button class="accordion">Your Player Level</button>
            <div class="panel">
              <p>Your player level increases as you win races. The placement score you win at the end of a race is affected by how high your player level is.</p>
            </div>

            <p>Inside Race Elements:</p>

            <button class="accordion">Doing a rocket start</button>
            <div class="panel">
              <p>Press down on “2” and release on “GO!” for the best rocket starts.</p>
            </div>
            
            <button class="accordion">Performing actions like doing turbo boosts, using speed panels, and doing jump boosts</button>
            <div class="panel">
              <p>All these actions grant a few points at a time, but they really do make a big difference in the end</p>
            </div>

            <button class="accordion">Collecting coins and mushrooms off the road</button>
            <div class="panel">
              <p>Collecting Coins and Mushrooms will give you a bunch of Bonus points</p>
            </div>

            <button class="accordion">Hitting Opponents with Items</button>
            <div class="panel">
                <p>Taking out your opponents grants a lot of bonus points. Additionally, Battle mode has a “Well Done!” bonus if you manage to win the battle within 90 seconds.</p>
            </div>

            <button class="accordion">Interacting with course elements</button>
            <div class="panel">
                <p>Things like pumpkins, Goombas, Rocky Wrenches, etc. give you points. Get creative with the course elements to boost your scores.</p>
            </div>
            
            <button class="accordion">Your final placement</button>
            <div class="panel">
                <p>Obviously, placing 1st will get you the biggest reward. Additionally, having a higher player level increases the reward you get!</p>
            </div>

            
            <button class="accordion">Doing actions in succession and getting combos.</button>
            <div class="panel">
                <p>Combos increase the amount of points you get after performing actions during a race. Getting a big string of combos means getting a bunch of additional bonus points.</p>
